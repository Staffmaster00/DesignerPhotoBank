Installing Core Technologies

Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is Microsoft's cross-platform editor that we'll be using during orientation for writing JavaScript and building Node applications. Make sure you add the JavaScript extension immediately after installation completes.

Alternatively use the text editor of your choice.
